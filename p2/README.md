# Project 2
+ By: *Laura Marshman*
+ Production URL: p2.lauramarshman.com

# Outside Resources
I used several outside resources for this project to assist me with troubleshooting errors I was running into. Here is a sample of the the main resources:
+ [Laravel Validation Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/validation#validation-quickstart)
+ [Laravel Customizing Error Messages](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/validation#quick-customizing-the-error-messages)
+ [Laravel HTTP Redirects](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/redirects)
+ I wasn't sure of the syntax for using old() with dropdown boxes so I referenced this [Stack overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48486540/how-to-keep-selected-value-in-dropdown-after-submit-in-laravel)

# Notes for Instructor
Taking into account feedback I received for Project 1, I tried to be a bit more purposeful with my code commenting for project 2. However, if I've gone too far in the other direction, please don't hesitate to let me know.
