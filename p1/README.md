## Outside resources
+ I used the [W3 Schools PHP reference](https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ref_overview.asp) guide quite a bit. I'm not very familiar with PHP syntax so I found myself using this resource extensively to double check both what functions are available in PHP, and also how to write them correctly.
+ As a supplemental resource, I also frequently used GeeksforGeeks as a secondary reference for PHP syntax in cases where W3 Schools wasn't quite indepth enough. Examples include:
    + ord()
    + chr()
    + ctype_alpha
+ I was struggling to use the preg_replace() function so I referenced the this [stack overflow page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/659025/how-to-remove-non-alphanumeric-characters).
