## Outside resources
I used the W3 Schools PHP reference (https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ref_overview.asp) guide quite a bit. I'm not very familiar with PHP syntax so I found myself using this resource extensively to double check both what functions are available in PHP, and also how to write them correctly.
