## Outside resources
+ I used the [W3 Schools PHP reference](https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ref_overview.asp) guide quite a bit. I'm not very familiar with PHP syntax so I found myself using this resource extensively to double check both what functions are available in PHP, and also how to write them correctly.
+ As a supplemental resource, I also frequently used GeeksforGeeks as a secondary reference for PHP syntax in cases where W3 Schools wasn't quite indepth enough. Examples include:
    + ord()
    + chr()
    + ctype_alpha
+ I was struggling to use the preg_replace() function so I referenced this [stack overflow page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/659025/how-to-remove-non-alphanumeric-characters).

## Notes for instructor
I commented my code and included a few notes for the instructor where it seemed appropriate. However, if any of the comments would be more appropriate to be placed here, pleae do not hesiate to let me know.
